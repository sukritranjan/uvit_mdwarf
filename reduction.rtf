\outl0\strokewidth0 \strokec2 Thank you for your email. I have added the write-up in the overleaf. For the talk, in the data reduction section, we can just mention that the observation was carried out in FUV-Grating1 and NUV-Grating. We have used CCDLAB to correct telescope drift and generate the final science ready image for an exposure time of 12 ks. Then we used the \'a0UVITTools package developed by Dewangan 2021, to extract spectra from the -2 order of FUV-Grating1 and from the -1 order of NUV grating. The zoomed-in FUV and NUV images are attached to this email, where different orders are also marked. You may show these images before showing the spectra. }
